# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently we do not offer security updates support for older
Orchest versions. This might change if an extremely critical security
issue is discovered. Generally speaking, we provide security updates
by releasing a new Orchest version. Upon discovering a security issue, we will release a security advisory.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities by emailing us at `rick@orchest.io` and `yannick@orchest.io`
or by sending a private message through our [slack community channel](https://join.slack.com/t/orchest/shared_invite/zt-g6wooj3r-6XI8TCWJrXvUnXKdIKU_8w).
