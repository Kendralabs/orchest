Environment variables
=====================

Environment variables let you exclude sensitive data from your versioning system.

Environment variables are injected in your pipeline steps, and can be natively retrieved with your chosen language. For example, in Python:

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   secret = os.environ["MY_VAR"]

You can define environment variables for Projects, Pipelines and Jobs. 

Pipeline variables overwrite Project variables. For example, if ``MY_VAR=PROJ_VALUE`` is defined at the Project level and ``MY_VAR=PIP_VALUE``
at the Pipeline level, the value of ``MY_VAR`` for an :term:`interactive pipeline runs <interactive (pipeline) run>` is ``PIP_VALUE``.

Changes to the ``PATH`` variable are ignored since they could break code execution.

.. warning::
   ðŸš¨ Environment variables are persisted within Orchest. Make sure only authorized users can acess your instance. See how to setup authentication in :ref:`orchest settings <orchest settings>`.

Project environment variables
-----------------------------

Project environment variables are visible to all Pipelines in that respective Project (including Pipelines in Jobs). Access your Project environment variables through Project settings:

1. Open the *Projects* view in the left menu pane.
2. Click on gear icon (in the *settings* column) in the row representing the project of interest.
3. Towards the top you will find the *Project environment variables* section.
4. Set your variables.
5. Click the *Save* button.

Pipeline environment variables
------------------------------

Access your Pipeline environment variables through the Pipeline settings:

1. Open a Pipeline via the *Pipelines* option in the left menu pane.
2. Click on *Settings* in the top right corner.
3. Click on the *Environment variables* tab.
4. Set your variables.
5. Click the *Save* button.

Job environment variables
-------------------------

Job environment variables are initialized by merging the Project and Pipeline environment variables when a Job is run. Add to/edit these variables before running the Job. Every Pipeline run belonging to this Job will include these environment variables.

.. note::
   ðŸ’¡ Only recurring scheduled jobs can have their environment variables edited after they have started.

Environment variables inside Notebooks
--------------------------------------

Environment variables are available in JupyterLab kernels too. Restart the :term:`interactive session <interactive session>` to refresh the kernels' environment variables.
