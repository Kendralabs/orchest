Projects
========
.. tip::
   ðŸ‘‰ A projects is the primary container for organizing related :ref:`pipelines
   <pipelines>`, :ref:`jobs <jobs>`, :ref:`environments <environments>` and code.

A project is basically just a ``git`` repository. For example, a Project might be organized like:

.. code-block:: sh

   .
   â”œâ”€â”€ .git/
   â”œâ”€â”€ .orchest
   â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ environments/
   â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pipelines/
   â”œâ”€â”€ california_housing.orchest
   â”œâ”€â”€ collect-results.ipynb
   â””â”€â”€ get-data.py

Projects also contain :ref:`jobs <jobs>`, however, these are not stored in the project's filesystem.

You can access Project files in your code running inside :ref:`environments <environments>`) using relative paths. For absolute paths, all files of a project are mounted to the ``/project-dir`` directory.

Getting started
---------------
You can get started with Projects by:
* Creating a new project
* Importing an existing project using its git repository URL (see :ref:`how to import a project <how to import a project>`).
* Importing Orchest curated or community contributed examples.

.. tip::
   ðŸ‘‰ See :ref:`quickstart tutorial <quickstart>`.

Project versioning
------------------

A Project's ``.orchest`` directory should be versioned since it defines the :ref:`environment <environments>` in use. This enables the Project to run on every machine.

The ``/data`` directory can be used to store data locally. The ``/data`` directory can be accessed by all pipelines across all projects, even by jobs.

Secrets should be set with :ref:`environment variables <environment variables>` to avoid them being versioned.

.. _git inside Orchest:

Using ``git`` inside Orchest
----------------------------
.. tip::
   ðŸ‘‰ See video tutorial: `versioning using git in Orchest
   <https://www.tella.tv/video/cknr9z9x0000709kz7vzh0wdx/view>`_.

You can use ``git`` inside Orchest with the pre-installed `jupyterlab-git <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git>`_ extension. Get started by adding your ``user.name`` and ``user.email`` in :ref:`configure JupyterLab <configuration jupyterlab>`. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   git config --global user.name "John Doe"
   git config --global user.email "john@example.org"

Use the following command to add a private SSH key to your terminal session in JupyterLab:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo "chmod 400 /data/id_rsa" >> ~/.bashrc
   echo "ssh-add /data/id_rsa 2>/dev/null" >> ~/.bashrc
   echo "if [ -z \$SSH_AGENT_PID ]; then exec ssh-agent bash; fi" >> ~/.bashrc
   mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   printf "%s\n" "Host github.com" " IdentityFile /data/id_rsa" >> ~/.ssh/config
   ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

Ensure the ``id_rsa`` private key file is uploaded through the pipeline file manager in the ``data/`` folder.

.. warning::
   ðŸš¨ Adding a private key file to the ``/data`` folder exposes it to everyone using your Orchest instance.

You can then version using ``git`` using:
* JupyterLab terminal.
* JupyterLab git extension UI.
