Installation
============

.. note::
   Orchest is in beta.

We provide three installation paths, installation through:

* our Python based CLI `orchest-cli <https://pypi.org/project/orchest-cli/>`_, or
* `kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl>`_, or
* `our Cloud offering <https://cloud.orchest.io/signup>`_ which comes with a free, fully configured
  Orchest instance.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use Orchest you will need a `Kubernetes (k8s) cluster <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/>`_. Any
cluster should work. You can either pick a managed service by one of the certified `cloud platforms
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/turnkey-solutions/>`_ or create a cluster
locally, e.g. using `minikube
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-intro/>`_.

Do make sure that, no matter the cluster you choose, the ingress controller is configured.

.. note::
   ðŸ’¡ We recommend to install Orchest on a clean cluster to prevent it clashing with existing
   cluster-level resources.

Setting up a ``minikube`` cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you already have a Kubernetes cluster to install Orchest on, then continue with :ref:`installing
Orchest <regular installation>`. In case you don't have a cluster yet, then `installing minikube
<https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/>`_ is a good solution in order to try out Orchest.

.. tip::
   ðŸ‘‰ We provide an automated convenience script for a complete minikube deployment. Taking care of
   installing ``minikube``, installing the ``orchest-cli`` and installing Orchest, run it with:

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl -fsSL https://get.orchest.io > convenience_install.sh
      bash convenience_install.sh

After installing minikube, create a minikube cluster and continue with :ref:`installing Orchest
<regular installation>`.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Create a minikube cluster and configure ingress.
   minikube start --cpus 4 --addons ingress

Installing ``minikube`` and Orchest on Windows
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For Orchest to work on Windows, Docker has to be configured to use WSL 2 (`Docker Desktop WSL 2
backend <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/>`_).

For all further steps make sure to run CLI commands inside a WSL terminal. You can do this by
opening the distribution using the Start menu or by `setting up the Windows Terminal
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-windows-terminal>`_.

.. _regular installation:

Install ``orchest`` via ``orchest-cli``
---------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade orchest-cli
   orchest install

Now the cluster can be reached on the IP returned by:

.. code-block:: bash

   minikube ip

.. tip::
   ðŸŽ‰ Now that you have installed Orchest, be sure to check out the :ref:`quickstart tutorial
   <quickstart>`.

Installing using an FQDN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you would rather reach Orchest using a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) instead of using the
cluster's IP directly, you can install Orchest using:

.. code-block:: bash

   orchest install --fqdn="localorchest.io"

.. or, if you have already installed Orchest but would like to set up an FQDN

Next, make Orchest reachable locally through the FQDN:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Set up the default Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in your
   # /etc/hosts so that you can reach Orchest locally.
   echo "$(minikube ip)\tlocalorchest.io" >> /etc/hosts

Installing without ``argo-workflow``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you already have an ``argo-workflow`` deployment in your cluster, the ``orchest-controller``
should be instructed to disable ``argo-workflow`` deployment to avoid colliding with the already installed one.

.. code-block:: bash

    orchest install --no-argo

Install ``orchest`` via ``kubectl``
-----------------------------------

.. tip::
   We recommend using the ``orchest-cli`` for installing and managing your Orchest Clusters
   (:ref:`link <regular installation>`).

The code snippet below will install Orchest in the ``orchest`` namespace. In case you want to
install in another namespace you can use tools like `yq <https://github.com/mikefarah/yq>`_ to
change the specified namespace in ``orchest-controller.yaml``.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Get the latest available Orchest version
   export VERSION=$(curl \
      "https://update-info.orchest.io/api/orchest/update-info/v3?version=None&is_cloud=False" \
      | grep -oP "v\d+\.\d+\.\d+")

   # Create the namespace to install Orchest in
   kubectl create ns orchest

   # Deploy the Orchest Operator
   kubectl apply \
     -f "https://github.com/orchest/orchest/releases/download/${VERSION}/orchest-controller.yaml"

   # Apply an OrchestCluster Custom Resource
   kubectl apply \
     -f "https://github.com/orchest/orchest/releases/download/${VERSION}/example-orchestcluster.yaml"

In case you want to configure the Orchest Cluster, you can patch the created ``OrchestCluster``.

Closing notes
-------------
Authentication is disabled by default after installation. Check out the :ref:`Orchest settings
<settings>` to learn how to enable it.
