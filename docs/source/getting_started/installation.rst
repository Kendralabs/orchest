Installation
============

.. note::
   Orchest is in beta.

.. tip::
   ðŸ‘‰ Get a fully configured Orchest instance out of the box on our `Orchest Cloud
   <https://cloud.orchest.io/signup>`_, for free!

Prerequisites
-------------

* `minikube <https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/>`_
* `helm <https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/>`_
* `kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl>`_
* make
* bash

Windows
~~~~~~~
For windows please install Orchest within the WSL 2.

.. note::
   Make sure you don't clone `orchest` in the paths shared with Windows (`/mnt/C/...` etc.).
   Due to permission handling in WSL2 this is not supported. Use the native filesystem in for example
   the Linux user home directory (`~/orchest`).

.. caution::
   For all further steps make sure to run CLI commands inside a WSL terminal. You can do this by
   opening the distribution using the Start menu or by `setting up the Windows Terminal
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-windows-terminal>`_.
